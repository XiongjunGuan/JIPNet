## Introduction
Currently, portable electronic devices are becoming more and more popular. For lightweight considerations, their fingerprint recognition modules usually use limited-size sensors. However, partial fingerprints have few matchable features, especially when there are differences in finger pressing posture or image quality, which makes partial fingerprint verification challenging. Most existing methods regard fingerprint position rectification and identity verification as independent tasks, ignoring the coupling relationship between them -- relative pose estimation typically relies on paired features as anchors, and authentication accuracy tends to improve with more precise pose alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint identity verification and pose alignment of partial fingerprint pairs, aiming to leverage their inherent correlation to improve each other. To achieve this, we present a multi-task CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-Transformer hybrid network, and design a pre-training task to enhance the feature extraction capability. Experiments on multiple public datasets (NIST SD14, FVC2002 DB1A & DB3A, FVC2004 DB1A & DB2A, FVC2006 DB1A) and an in-house dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both partial fingerprint verification and relative pose estimation, while being more efficient than previous methods.

The overall flowchart of our proposed algorithm is shown as follows.

## Notice :exclamation:
The publicly available weights are only applicable to the testing scenarios in our paper. 

If you want to achieve better results, please retrain or fine tune in your local dataset.

## Requirements
```shell
einops==0.8.1
numpy==2.2.5
opencv_contrib_python==4.10.0.84
opencv_python==4.8.1.78
PyYAML==6.0.2
scipy==1.15.2
skimage==0.0
timm==0.9.12
torch==2.1.2
tqdm==4.66.1
```

<br>



## Train
:point_up: If you want to train JIPNet, please first construct the training set and overview file `example.npy` in the form of the following example:
```
|-data
  |-img/...         # images for training
  |-info/...        # pair info for training
  |-example.npy   # overview file
```

:point_up: Next, you need to adjust the file path, network structure, and training parameters according to your needs:
```
./configs/JIPNet.yaml
```

:point_up: Finally, set the corresponding configuration path in the training file to train JIPNet !
```shell
python train_JIPNet.py
```

:triangular_flag_on_post: The pretrained encoder is uploaded at `./JIPNet/encoder_bath.pth` in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q9yopPjOFt9c9odCT1o4nheLvwrJaCu7?usp=sharing).

If you are interested in this part, you can refer to our other repository for training fingerprint enhancement networks.
https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/FpEnhancer

Note that the network of above repository‌ has been adjusted, and its weight cannot be directly applied to JIPNet.


:sparkles: At present, the training code has not been fully organized yet, and there may be some bugs that have not been discovered. Please feel free to discuss with me. :kissing_heart:

## Train Data Generation

:point_up: First, prepare your data following the `FVC` naming format:
`{FINGER_ID}_{IMPRESSION_ID}`

:point_up: Next, extract the required features, such as binary images and minutiae.
(This step is optional—they are mainly used for rigid registration and mask extraction. You may use alternative methods if preferred.)

:point_up: Finally, run the following commands:

```shell
cd ./make_data

# We use VeriFinger for rigid registration.
# This script will not run successfully due to licensing restrictions, and the source code cannot be released. It is provided for reference only.
python affine_pairs.py 

# Assuming you already have aligned data (genuine matches).
# Perfect alignment is not required; approximate alignment based on relative finger positions is sufficient.
python exrtact_mask.py 

# !! Each image must have at least one true match and one false match.
# Random cropping parameters can be adjusted in the code.
python generate_path.py

```

## Test Data Preparation

The file structure in the example code is as follows:
```shell
root_path/examples/
├── data
|   ├── 0_1.png
|   ├── 0_2.png
|   ├── ......
├── result
|   ├── method
|   |   ├── 0.png
|   |   ├── 0.txt
|   |   ├── ......
```
Input paired images (`ftitle_1.png, ftitle_2.png`), output aligned results (`ftitle.png`) and classification probabilities/relative pose vectors (`ftitle.txt`).
